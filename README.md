nebula2d
========

Nebula2D is a cross-platform 2D video game engine under development for PC, Mac, and Linux. N2D's philosophy is develop once, deploy many. With the integration of javascript scripting language, developers will be able to write their game's code without the need to think about platform specific pitfalls. An intuitive front end world editor will enable designers to create their game's universe with an easy to use WYSIWYG interface.

Nebula2D will be able to export builds to any of PC, Mac, Linux, and Android OS (including OUYA), with eventual support for iOS and other platforms as time goes on.
