Nebula2D is a cross-platform 2D video game engine under development for PC, Linux, and Android OS. N2D's philosophy is develop once, deploy many. With the integration of Lua scripting language, developers will be able to write their game's code without the need to think about platform specific pitfalls. An intuitive front end world editor will enable designers to create their game's universe with an easy to use WYSIWYG interface.
